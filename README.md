Racer (aka Internet Racer) is a STEM learning project that explorers developing a small robotic vehicle with can be remotely controlled over the internet.
This project features 3 levels of engagement:

3D Design and Printing
An Autodesk Fusion drawing is included which provides an example vehicle body. The body can be extended, changed, or even completely ignored.

Arduino Programming
An ESP32-C6 provides the main command and control functionality. Included is the code to drive this chip.

Bot Control
Simple BOT control language can be written which can be sent from a laptop to a MQTT server. The ERacer monitors the MQTT queue and will execute all commands found.
